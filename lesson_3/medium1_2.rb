#puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)

# The error will be about not being able to convert Integer into String - the evaluated result of (40 + 2) is the Integer 42. Integer objects can't be concatenated into String objects - they are different object types.

# Fix 1: convert 42 into a string, then concatenate
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s

# Fix 2: Interpolate the Integer addition into the string
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}"
